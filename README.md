**Web-based environment for evolutionary sequence analysis and data visualisation.**  
Wasabi visualises sequence data together with a phylogenetic tree within a modern, user-friendly interface.  
It automatically stores intermediate analysis steps with data sharing links, supports PRANK and PAGAN aligners and is extendable with plugins.
